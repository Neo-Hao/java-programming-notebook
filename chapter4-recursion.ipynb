    "## Section 1. The basics of Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "The process in which a function (or method) calls itself is called recursion, and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. A good example of recursion is the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers, in which each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. As a result, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. The mathematical equation describing it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fib(0) = 0\n",
    "fib(1) = 1\n",
    "fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating this to Java code, you will have:\n",
    "```\n",
    "public int fib(int n) {\n",
    "    if (n <= 0) {return 0;}\n",
    "    else if (n == 1) {return 1;}\n",
    "    else {\n",
    "        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is important to note that code always executes from top to bottom and from left to right. When part of the code can not finish its execution, it will not move to the other parts. For instance, when we want to calculate fib(5), the traced execution will be like a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fib.png\" alt=\"index\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the second level, there are fib(4) and fib(3). fib(4), its children, grandchildren, and the entire subtree will be executed first. After that, the calculation of fib(3) will start.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.1 When do you need recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most problems that can be solved using recursive solutions can also be solved using iterative solutions. Sometimes it can be difficult to think about how to proceed using iterations to solve certain problems, and it is typically a signal that recursions may be the right way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.2 How do you use recursion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most recursions follow the same template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public dataType method(problem) {\n",
    "    if (problem is sufficiently simple) {\n",
    "        Directly solve the problem\n",
    "        Return the solution\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        Solve the problem a little bit until the subproblem with the same pattern emerges\n",
    "        Call the same method recursively\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let's try to solve the following problem using recursion:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Implement the power function pow. pow takes two parameters. The first parameter is the base, while the second is the power. You can safely assume that the power is bigger than or equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*pow(3, 2) = 9 \n",
    "*pow(3, 3) = 27\n",
    "*pow(2, 5) = 32\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to figure out is the base case - when the problem is sufficiently simple. The simplest case for power calculation is when the power is 0. When the power is 0, The result is always 1 no matter what the base is, so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public int pow(int base, int power) {\n",
    "    if (power == 0) {\n",
    "        return 1;\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        // something\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the other cases, we need to solve the problem a little bit until the subproblem with the same pattern emerges. Power calculation is essentially multiplying the same base number for as many times as power. Solving it bit by bit is just keep multiplying the same base number to the result, so taking one step to solve the problem just means doing the multiplication manually for one time. The remaining part will have exactly the same pattern but with a smaller power: *pow(base, power - 1)*. In summary, you can update your code to:\n",
    "```\n",
    "public int pow(int base, int power) {\n",
    "    if (power == 0) {\n",
    "        return 1;\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        return base * pow(base, power-1);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code snippets are listed in the following code cell. You are welcome to try them out and change the parameter values, and you may need to comment out some lines to get a clear sense of the ones you want to study."
